### Notes

* Let's build a registry for
    * plugins built by the community
    * projects built on top of Veramo
    * There is a proto-registry in [the Awesome list](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo/blob/next/AWESOME.md), but it needs more structure and better maintenance.
* We need a public roadmap with
    * features or plugins proposed
    * things being worked on
* Still unanswered
    * How to work with Veramo in non-JS tech-stacks (when is the OpenAPI interface not enough?)
* How to get in touch?
    * VeramoLabs discord server: https://discord.gg/HEFfWxSfFv
    * DIF discord / veramo-user-group channel: https://discord.gg/U7SVjGqgZz
